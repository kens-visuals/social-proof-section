## My process

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS Grid
- CSS Flexbox
- CSS Animations
- SCSS custom properties
- Mobile-first workflow

### Continued development

I experimented with CSS grid in this project, and I'm really excited to practice it more in my future pojects. I'm going to build much more complex layouts, which will be really fun with Css grid.

### Useful resources
